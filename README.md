# üèÜ Hacker League

Welcome to **Hacker League** ‚Äì an innovative gamification system designed to recognize and reward the best contributors of HackerSchool through a structured competitive framework. This project transforms the existing HackNights into a formal gaming experience that celebrates multiple forms of merit and contribution.

## üìú Project History

This project was originally named **"HS-WebApp"** and was developed by Jos√© Lopes ([@MIBismuth](https://github.com/MIBismuth) on GitHub). It served as the first stone in building the **Hacker League** ecosystem. The original project has been preserved in the legacy branch, while active development continues on the main branch.

## üéØ Vision & Concept

### Core Philosophy
The system focuses on **recognizing members who already contribute actively** to HackerSchool rather than just increasing participation. Each point awarded must have clear justification and be intrinsically linked to HackerSchool values.
